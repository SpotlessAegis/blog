                    <h4>
                        Hey y'all! Welcome to my blog. I'm Spotless, shortened from my online alias,<br> “SpotlessDentures”. This is a small introduction post of myself and what to expect here. 

                        <br><br>

                        First of all, disclaimer. My blogs and rants are not meant to be taken 100% seriously. There is some truth to things I say and some things that I say are for shock value, 
                        but never in a severely offensive context. (I also don't want to receive a cease and desist email because I supposedly 'slandered' something). It's just fun and games and 
                        most things that will be uploaded here is 75% nonsense unless completely specified. I currently don't have an upload schedule but I assume at least once every or every other
                        week.
                        
                        <br><br>

                        What I write is gonna be about a variety of topics, literally whatever I feel like writing.  If people actually are visiting my site I may open a comment section or 
                        an FAQ on a google form. Maybe not a comment section. 
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        Anyways, here's like a little about me. I started this blog because I talk way to much, and without people 
                        really giving a shit about what I say because it's just a huge long rant. Who'd want to read a huge long rant? There's a certain market out there, and it's definitely not 
                        my buddies. I have a long post about some random thing at least a few times a week. So I decided to put my energy into blog articles. 
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        If you look at the little <strong>extras</strong> tab 
                        to your right, you can see that I like K-pop (If you bothered to click on Xiumin). Will I talk about K-pop a lot or become a K-pop blog, talking about what's relevant and 
                        rating songs? Nah. I don't want to be stuck to one topic. But you will see images of idols here and there. I don't think I'll even write one at all. For now of course. 

                        <br><br>

                        If I'm serious about this blog you might see me write about it. Or if I run out of ideas. I also really like the color pink. So thanks for reading my introduction! '3'</h4>
