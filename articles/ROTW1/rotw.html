There are so many types of people out there, like the cliques in stereotypical highschool movies. I wouldn't say there are jocks, cheerleaders, preppies or anything like 
that around me personally. Not everything is black and white and everyone is different. But what makes them all the same is how they act. All these people act so insufferable 
that it's hard to find some decent people. But it's definitely possible. Just remove all the invasive weeds so you can grow some nice flowers.

<br><br>

It's surprising how many idiots are out here posting on social media, talking about their “ops” and flexing about being hated. Like take a moment to think about reality. 
People hate these kinds of losers for a reason, nobody is out to get them, and frankly nobody really cares. Then these people have their little friends hyping these fours while everyone else in a 30 mile radius around them despise them because of how insufferable and stupid they are. These people act like hot shit when they go picking fights with strangers and pretend like they win when in reality that said stranger is weirded out by some kid trying to act tough. If a fight of theirs was posted on Twitter, people in the comment section would make fun of how shitty these types of people fight. It makes me hope that someone beats the shit out of these people and puts them in their place.

<br><br>

My last paragraph can be applied to any gender. But for this specific one I'll be ranting about girls. Let me put out the most typical of them all (at least in my area): The BASIC of basic bitches. 
Lululemon leggings, dirty ass air forces (please wash them) and random hoodies (hoodies that probably belong to their wildly racist boyfriend but it's okay because he's their boyfriend). 
I don't want to make fun of how people dress, anybody is entitled to whatever clothing goes on their backs and I am an avid supporter of this idea. But I'm going to make fun of how these people 
act because they get on my nerves sometimes, and to get a visual of them, I must describe them. The way they all pose is odd, it's nice on some but makes others look deformed. They all talk the 
same, hang out with their clones and male clone counterparts, it's all kind of eerie. The only difference would be their race and hair color, but do you think a person of color would hang out with 
these people? Or do you think that people of color would be allowed in their Ku Klux Klub?? The only people of color I do see hanging out with them make degrading race jokes of themselves 24/7 to 
appeal to the white members of the cult-friend group. It's sad. Be who you are! 

<br><br>

Next is the type of girl you only see online. And they all clones too. Girls who have that cutesy anime aesthetic with little anime girls who have their guts hanging out. They also are unhealthy 
attached to their boyfriends, and have no life outside of posting themselves on social media, smoking, and their boyfriends who probably like girls who look underage. Please, get a hobby or a job. 
Why are you waiting outside your boyfriend's 9-5 job while he has six hours left on the clock. Is your life really that fucking sad? They make cringey posts online about how they would “kill any 
bitch that goes near him”. No you won't. Nuh uh. You can't even ask for a ketchup packet at McDonald's yet you think you can do anything? In fact, instead of killing other girls how about you kill 
yourself. 

<br><br>

Also, they have no personality outside of having a boyfriend and being the dream girl of discord mods. Then they post videos of themselves being groped and manhandled by their boyfriend 
while they dress like little girls. I would personally suggest getting a pet, like a cat. That'll keep you occupied for some time so you don't have to loiter around your boyfriend's workplace. 
These girls also fantasize about a Lolita situation. Having a Humbert in their life while being a Delores. And by “being a Delores”, I mean being as tiny and skinny as possible. Romanticize 
anorexia, sure. Go tell young girls to slit their wrists and only have Diet Coke and a cigarette for the entire day so they'll be skinny and desirable. It's gross to fetishize such a traumatic 
situation. Child abuse isn't so “Lana Del Rey vinyl” as these girls make it out to be. These types of girls also mix with the anime fascists who wanna make themselves look East Asian while usually 
being white. East Asian baiting doesn't only apply to white people, obviously. But in this context how many black weeaboo anorexic Nazi's are out there online. There are some obviously, but to be a 
neo Nazi AND a person of color is so funny to me. They don't want you bro! In fact, they want you dead. And I'm sure without your boyfriend you'd want yourself dead, huh?

<br><br>

And to think I would forget about boys. The male counterpart of the BASIC of basic girls, where do I begin? These boys are the racist, homophobic, and over all assholes that their girlfriends, 
who by association and condoning of this behavior, are also racist themselves. If you don't consider your boyfriend's behavior bad, then YOU are also bad. “B-but he's not like that! He's nice to 
me, he's a good guy.” Yeah maybe he's nice because you are straight, white, cisgender, Christian girl who puts bible quotes in her bio but Cherry picks what she wants to follow. And also 
conventionally attractive. How could these kind of boys ever respect any “female” they don't find attractive? That's gay! I hope these boys go back to fishing large bass, shooting deers in the 
forest (then when they grow up they'll shoot minorities and call it justice), and ride their little dirt bikes. Also those large, blue-green glasses are U-G-L-Y.

<br><br>

Since I brought up women that live online, I'll talk about the men that love these women. They are WAY worse than the girls with attachment problems and severe daddy issues. These guys get zero 
bitches and think it's the problem of the bitches and not themselves. Then they go on and develop these extremely disgusting and problematic views, as if their behavior wasn't bad enough. 
And those edge lords that reside in the depths of Reddit, Twitter, and the surface area of NewGrounds are just terrible. Not in like a “danger to society” way, but a “this man is extremely horny 
and mentally ill” way. Constantly drawing porn with the freakiest fetishes while living in someone's basement as an old man. Maybe that's their income, cater to horny weirdos online who would
 prefer an anime child over real women. Just degenerates online being, well, degenerates.
