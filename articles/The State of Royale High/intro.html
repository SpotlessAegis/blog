                        <hr/>
                    <h4 style="text-align: left">
                        Back in 2017, I used to be really obsessed with a game on Roblox called Royale High. I was into a kids show called “The Winx Club” and since it started off as a 
                        Winx Club I was sold. It has come a long way since then. The game is beautiful and the clothing items are well detailed and it obviously took a long time. 
                        The new school trailer is amazing. The game is visually appealing. However, there have been many problems, even when the game has shifted from a Winx Club game to its own. 
                        I have nitpicks of my own, but there are also problems that some players have reported. 

                        <br><br>

                        Royale High really likes to make their game impossible to be enjoyed by new players, unless you want to immediately spend money to get certain features or buy the in-game 
                        currency. It's difficult for newer players to progress. “But Spotless, there are ways you can receive diamonds without paying real money for it, why can't you do that?”. 
                        (If you are unaware, diamonds are the main currency for the game. But there are also different currencies for holidays and events, such as candy.) While there are in-game 
                        methods to earn diamonds, such as Sunset Island. Sunset Island is a pageant-like game where people dress up and compete for diamonds. The game is done in rounds. 
                        However, the rounds take a long time. Three rounds alongside an intermission may take a little under an hour. And what do people, usually new players get? 
                        Maybe 250 diamonds and some experience points if you didn't place those three rounds. I've played Sunset Island a lot, especially during quarantine. 
                        However, waiting forever for the round to start and get to voting is boring. Toxic players complain about everything, such as when they don't win. 
                        Then they talk shit about the winners of the round, and are overall just annoying. There's this mindset where people vote for whoever they think won't win. 
                        But everybody thinks that way and that person ends up winning. Then people act so shocked as if they aren't brain dead enough to literally vote for them because they 
                        think it'll give themselves a higher chance of winning but literally EVERYBODY thinks this. Or when people slap on a “high demand”, or “rare” item like the LTBS, or a halo 
                        and they have a higher chance of winning because of what I said earlier, brain dead players. However, that's just me nitpicking, not everybody acts that way, but it's a 
                        hell of a lot of people. 
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        Overall, I did enjoy Sunset Island but it feels outdated. It is far from an effective way to farm diamonds unless people have hours to spend doing 
                        barely anything to earn basically nothing. The same goes for any other method of farming, they're all time consuming and people don't earn much, especially when other 
                        players are competing on “Who Gets the Red Diamond” at the school(literally only 20 diamonds). What I see many players want in the game are jobs, and I agree. There should 
                        be a more efficient way of doing Sunset Island so that it doesn't drag on forever and become monotonous. But on a positive note, I like the login system.

                        <br><br>

                        Let me bring up the cost of items for a brief moment. What the fuck. There is no reason why the prices of  many simple items are through the fucking roof. 
                        I wouldn't mind the prices if earning diamonds was easier. I'm not saying I want diamonds handed to me, but I don't want to spend an hour doing the same things over and 
                        over get diamonds. However, most items that are actually good and pair well with most outfits are extremely expensive. I don't think people would want to buy a 5,000 
                        diamond accessory that is easily hidden by most other items and is barely noticeable. Or people can pay for diamonds, whatever. But at least make it easy for Free to Play 
                        players to actually get these items without spending hours on the game. People have lives and might not have all the time in the world to grind. I have an idea, it might 
                        seem a little far fetched but, what if they made items more accessible? When you have items that cost a bunch of diamonds, only few people have it and then the trading 
                        system goes crazy and inflates the ever living shit out of that item. Trading is a whole other topic I don't even know if I'll get on.

                        <br><br>

                        Anyways, ever since the new school area was in development, it was like every other aspect of the game was abandoned and left in the dark as new features were added. 
                        Changing systems are buggy, things like badges and decals aren't showing up, the game's “Dress Up” menu is constantly freezing, the shop isn't loading, nothing rendering 
                        properly at all. What happened to the developer team? Is it just Barbie working on the game? Shouldn't the other developers work on Royale High too? If they are the ones 
                        defending Barbie and being harassed by Royale High players during the Black History Month incident, where a tribute was removed, while Barbie does nothing, shouldn't they 
                        be able to touch the game? Is it just Barbie and Launce? Oh wait, I understand. Most people getting the heat were item designers. Not even developers. Most of them were 
                        also minors as well. I don't want to bash anyone (only that terrible side of the fanbase though) but come on. This game feels unplayable sometimes. You'd think it's a 
                        problem with your device, but no. The game isn't being updated with slight changes that would make everything better. Anyways,since I brought up the new school I should 
                        actually talk about it because it's been announced that it's here! Finally!

                        <br><br>

                        The new school looks great. I don't want to nitpick the visual design because there's nothing inherently wrong with it from what I see. Although it was promised 
                        constantly before finally having a trailer drop a few days ago, I'm curious to see what will be different about this school. Once it finally releases, maybe the developers 
                        can spend their new found time fixing their game!

                        <br><br>

                        There are a whole lot of other criticisms I can pour out about this game, but I've decided I'm not going to write about it. The decline of players is tragic, but that's 
                        what happens when you make a game that's only enjoyable when you have these certain items, are at a certain level, and have tons of Robux to fill the pockets of the 
                        developers. I'd like to say that I'm in the demographic because I spent about 4 years getting to where I'm currently at in the game. Whenever I log onto the game, I just 
                        hang out in the apartment and role play by myself because that's more enjoyable than being AFK in the trading hub. However, if someone new starts out, it's going to be 
                        difficult to get to a point of having a nice experience with the game because of the developers.
